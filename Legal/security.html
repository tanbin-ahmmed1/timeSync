        <h1>Security - TimeSync</h1>

        <p>At TimeSync, the security of your data is a top priority. We understand the sensitive nature of medical information and have implemented a comprehensive security framework to protect it. This page outlines the measures we take to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data.</p>

        <h2>1. Data Encryption</h2>
        <p>We utilize robust encryption techniques to protect your data both in transit and at rest:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data in Transit:</strong> All communication between your device and our servers is secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption. This ensures that your data is protected from eavesdropping as it travels across the internet.</li>
            <li><strong>Data at Rest:</strong> Sensitive data is encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms when stored on our servers. This provides an added layer of protection in case of unauthorized access to our storage systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Access Controls</h2>
        <p>We implement strict access controls to limit who can access your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Principle of Least Privilege:</strong> Access to data is granted only to personnel who require it to perform their specific job duties.</li>
            <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> Access permissions are based on user roles, ensuring that users only have access to the information and functionalities necessary for their role.</li>
            <li><strong>Strong Authentication:</strong> We enforce strong password policies and may implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to provide an extra layer of security for user accounts.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Access Reviews:</strong> We conduct periodic reviews of user access rights to ensure they remain appropriate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Infrastructure Security</h2>
        <p>Our infrastructure is designed with security in mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Secure Hosting Environment:</strong> We utilize reputable hosting providers with robust security measures, including physical security, network firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Firewall Protection:</strong> We employ firewalls to control network traffic and prevent unauthorized access to our systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):</strong> We use IDPS to monitor our network for suspicious activity and automatically respond to potential threats.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Security Patching:</strong> We diligently apply security patches and updates to our operating systems, software, and applications to address known vulnerabilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Integrity and Backup</h2>
        <p>We take measures to ensure the integrity and availability of your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Regular Backups:</strong> We perform regular backups of our data to prevent data loss in the event of system failures or other incidents.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Integrity Checks:</strong> We implement mechanisms to detect and prevent unauthorized modifications to your data.</li>
            <li><strong>Disaster Recovery Plan:</strong> We have a disaster recovery plan in place to ensure business continuity and data recovery in the event of a significant disruption.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Security Audits and Vulnerability Testing</h2>
        <p>We proactively assess our security posture through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> We conduct periodic internal and external security audits to evaluate the effectiveness of our security controls.</li>
            <li><strong>Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> We perform regular vulnerability scans to identify potential weaknesses in our systems and applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Penetration Testing:</strong> We may engage third-party security experts to conduct penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify areas for improvement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Compliance with Healthcare Regulations</h2>
